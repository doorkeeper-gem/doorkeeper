## Example Applications

These applications show how Doorkeeper works and how to integrate with it. Start with the oAuth2 server and use the clients to connect with the server.

| Application | Link |
| :--- | :--- |
| OAuth2 Server with Doorkeeper | [doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-provider-app](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-provider-app) |
| Sinatra Client connected to Provider App | [doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-sinatra-client](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-sinatra-client) |
| Devise + Omniauth Client | [doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-devise-client](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-devise-client) |

You may want to create a client application to
test the integration. Check out these [client
examples](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/wiki/Example-Applications)
in our wiki or follow this [tutorial
here](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/wiki/Testing-your-provider-with-OAuth2-gem).

## Development

To run the local engine server:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake doorkeeper:server
````

By default, it uses the latest Rails version with ActiveRecord. To run the
tests with a specific Rails version:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6_0.gemfile bundle exec rake
```

You can also experiment with the changes using `bin/console`. It uses in-memory SQLite database and default
Doorkeeper config, but you can reestablish connection or reconfigure the gem if you need.
