      # server and the information it keeps about its tokens, but a "true"
      # value return for the "active" property will generally indicate
      # that a given token has been issued by this authorization server,
      # has not been revoked by the resource owner, and is within its
      # given time window of validity (e.g., after its issuance time and
      # before its expiration time).

      #
      #    o  If the token can expire, the authorization server MUST determine
      #       whether or not the token has expired.
      #    o  If the token can be issued before it is able to be used, the
      #       authorization server MUST determine whether or not a token's valid
      #       period has started yet.
      #    o  If the token can be revoked after it was issued, the authorization
      #       server MUST determine whether or not such a revocation has taken
      #       place.
      #    o  If the token has been signed, the authorization server MUST
      #       validate the signature.
      #    o  If the token can be used only at certain resource servers, the
      #       authorization server MUST determine whether or not the token can
      #       be used at the resource server making the introspection call.
