# of increasing the boot-up time by auto-requiring all files in the support

# require only the support files necessary.

  #
  #     RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :request do
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #
  # The different available types are documented in the features, such as in
  # https://rspec.info/features/8-0/rspec-rails
  #
  # You can also this infer these behaviours automatically by location, e.g.
  # /spec/models would pull in the same behaviour as `type: :model` but this
  # behaviour is considered legacy and will be removed in a future version.
  #
  # To enable this behaviour uncomment the line below.
