    #
    # RFC7009
    # Section 5. Security Considerations
    # A malicious client may attempt to guess valid tokens on this endpoint
    # by making revocation requests against potential token strings.
    # According to this specification, a client's request must contain a
    # valid client_id, in the case of a public client, or valid client
    # credentials, in the case of a confidential client. The token being
    # revoked must also belong to the requesting client.
    #
    # Once a confidential client is authenticated, it must be authorized to
    # revoke the provided access or refresh token. This ensures one client
    # cannot revoke another's tokens.
    #
    # Doorkeeper determines the client type implicitly via the presence of the
    # OAuth client associated with a given access or refresh token. Since public
    # clients authenticate the resource owner via "password" or "implicit" grant
    # types, they set the application_id as null (since the claim cannot be
    # verified).
